# jBetaBrite

A Java interface for communicating with the [BetaBrite](http://betabrite.com/) series of LED text displays.

Why?  Well, because LED displays are cooler than boring old general-purpose monitors.

## Requirements & Setup

- A connected to BetaBrite device via (real or virtual) RS-232 port
- The [jRS232 package](http://www.github.com/willmeyer/jrs232) and its `com.willmeyer.jrs232`, with its install requirements

## Using the Library

See `com.willmeyer.jbetabrite.Sign`, the basic sign interface.
